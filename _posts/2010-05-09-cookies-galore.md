I've spent the better part of the day making cookies!   I tried a few interesting combos, which I'll detail at the end of this post.  For those that are interested, the recipe is as follows...

* 125g Unsalted butter
* 100g Granulated sugar
* 75g Soft brown sugar
* 1 Egg
* 2 tsp Vanilla extract
* 150g Plain flour
* 0.5tsp Baking powder
* Pinch of salt
* 100g Fillings

Preheat oven to 190°C and line some baking trays with parchment.

Melt the butter gently over a low heat

In a bowl, mix the sugars together, add the melted butter and beat together.

Add the egg and vanilla and beat again.

Sift in the flour, baking powder and salt and stir.

Add the fillings and stir again.  Leave to stand for 10 minutes to stiffen.

Dot ~1tsp balls on the baking sheet around 5 cm apart.  This will make ~4cm cookies.

Bake for 8-10 minutes, then leave on sheet for 10 minutes to cool and harden.

## Varieties

The fillings can be anything, today I tried:

* Milk chocolate
* White chocolate
* Milk chocolate and candied orange peel (50/50)
* Milk chocolate and glacé cherries (50/50)
* Milk chocolate and red chilli (half a red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped)
* Milk chocolate and hazelnuts (50/50)
